# camera_pro

A Flutter camera package built on a shared C/C++ core with a crash-proof Dart API and a capability passport pattern — designed for production-quality camera UX across all platforms.

---

> **Project status: working camera engine (v0.1.0, pre-release)**
>
> On macOS the example app opens the real camera and does live preview, all six manual controls, five live visual-aid overlays (histogram, focus peaking, zebra, false color, waveform — GPU-accelerated via Metal where available), PNG + RAW/DNG capture with EXIF, burst, EV bracketing, and H.264 video recording — every one of those verified live against real hardware. The same AVFoundation backend compiles for iOS with sensor-level manual controls. **Web** runs in the browser too: a getUserMedia backend with live preview, capture, and the visual aids reimplemented in pure Dart — verified in Chrome with screenshots ([see below](#web)). Linux (V4L2) and Windows (Media Foundation) backends implement the full HAL contract and pass CI on real ubuntu/windows runners (camera-hardware runtime pending machines with cameras). Android is not started — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the honest gate on every remaining item.

## Why camera_pro?

Most Flutter camera packages wrap platform APIs directly and surface raw exceptions. `camera_pro` takes a different approach:

| Design choice | What it means for you |
|---|---|
| **Shared C core** | Image processing (histograms, YUV→RGBA conversion, focus peaking, zebra) runs the same bit-exact code on every platform, compiled with SIMD where available (NEON on arm64). |
| **HAL abstraction** | A C platform-abstraction layer (`camera_hal.h`) separates the core from each platform backend. Adding a new platform means implementing one HAL contract, not forking the whole package. |
| **Capability passport** | Every feature the camera reports is a `Capability<T>` — either `Supported<T>` (with current value, min, max, step) or `NotSupported<T>` (with a reason string). Your UI never crashes trying to set a feature the device doesn't have. |
| **Typed errors** | A sealed `CameraProError` hierarchy with a `CameraErrorRecovery` hint on every error. No raw platform exceptions bubble up unchecked. |
| **Dart FFI + native assets** | The C core is compiled automatically at build time via Flutter's native-assets hook. No manual `.so`/`.dylib` bundling. |
| **Tier system** | `CameraTier { full, standard, basic }` is derived from the capability passport. Your UI can adapt layout to what the hardware actually supports. |

| Flutter texture registration | 🚧 | API surface designed; not connected |

### Manual controls

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ISO setter (`setIso`) | ✅ | Capability-guarded; throws `CameraFeatureNotSupportedError` if not supported |
| Shutter speed setter (`setShutterSpeed`) | ✅ | Capability-guarded |
| Exposure compensation setter (`setExposureCompensation`) | ✅ | Capability-guarded |
| White balance setter (`setWhiteBalance`) | ✅ | Preset and temperature modes |

| Manual controls — macOS (digital) | ✅ | The built-in camera exposes **no** sensor controls (measured across AVFoundation, CoreMediaIO, and IOKit/USB — see note below), so ISO, shutter, exposure, white balance, focus, and zoom are applied by a **digital pipeline** in the C core (`camera_pro_adjust_pixels`, `camera_pro_digital_zoom`, `camera_pro_box_blur`). Verified changing the live feed. → `CameraTier.full` |

## Platform support

| Platform | Camera access | C core + stub | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | 🚧 | ✅ | NDK Camera2 HAL designed, not wired |
| iOS | ✅ controls + preview | ✅ | AVFoundation HAL: enumeration, capabilities, manual controls, live preview (compiled vs iOS SDK) |
| macOS | ✅ preview + manual | ✅ | Live preview streaming on real cameras; full manual control set (ISO/shutter/exposure/WB/focus/zoom) via the digital pipeline since the built-in camera exposes no sensor controls → `CameraTier.full` |
| Windows | ✅ CI | ✅ | Media Foundation backend (full 44-fn contract) compiles + lifecycle harness runs on CI; camera runtime ⛔ needs hardware |
| Linux | ✅ CI | ✅ | V4L2 backend (full contract, mmap streaming) compiles + lifecycle harness runs on CI; camera runtime ⛔ needs hardware |
| Web | ✅ | ✅ (pure Dart) | getUserMedia backend + pure-Dart visual aids; builds and runs in the browser, browser tests pass in CI |

All platforms get the C core and stub backend today. Platform camera access requires the corresponding HAL implementation.

## Installation

`camera_pro` is not yet published to pub.dev. Add it as a path or git dependency:

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml

dependencies:
  camera_pro:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/sayed3li97/camera_pro.git
      ref: main   # or pin to a commit SHA for reproducibility
```

**Native assets requirement.** The C core is compiled automatically via Flutter's native-assets feature. This is enabled by default in Flutter 3.22 and later. No manual `.so`/`.dylib` bundling is needed.

Verify your Flutter version supports native assets:

```sh
flutter --version
# Flutter 3.22.0 or later required
```

---

## Quick start

The following snippet works today. You get a stub backend (no real camera frames), but the FFI call into the C core, the capability passport, the state machine, and typed errors are all live:

```dart
import 'package:camera_pro/camera_pro.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // nativeCoreVersion is a real FFI call into the compiled C core.
  print(CameraPro.nativeCoreVersion); // "0.1.0"
  print(CameraPro.simdKernel);        // "NEON" on arm64, "scalar" otherwise

  // create() returns a controller backed by the stub HAL until a platform HAL lands.
  final controller = await CameraPro.create();

  print(controller.tier);   // CameraTier.basic on stub

  // Capability passport: check before building UI.
  switch (controller.capabilities.iso) {
    case Supported<int>(:final currentValue, :final minValue, :final maxValue):
      print('ISO $currentValue  [$minValue – $maxValue]');
      // Show ISO slider.
    case NotSupported<int>(:final reason):
      print('ISO not supported: $reason');
      // Disable ISO control.
  }

  // Typed setters — never crash; throw CameraProError subtypes on misuse.
  try {
    await controller.setIso(const Iso(400));
  } on CameraFeatureNotSupportedError catch (e) {
    print('${e.feature}: ${e.message}  recovery: ${e.recovery}');
  } on CameraInvalidParameterError catch (e) {
    print('Bad value: ${e.message}');
  }

  // White balance: preset or Kelvin temperature.
  await controller.setWhiteBalance(WhiteBalance.preset(WhiteBalanceMode.daylight));
  await controller.setWhiteBalance(WhiteBalance.temperature(5500));

  // Listen to state transitions.
  controller.stateChanges.listen((state) => print('Camera state: $state'));

  await controller.dispose();
}
```

## Verified this build

The following results were produced on macOS arm64 with Flutter 3.44.1 / Dart 3.12.1:

| Test suite | Result |
|---|---|
| C core (`clang -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`) | **60/60 checks pass** (arm64 NEON) |
| Same harness compiled x86_64, run under **Rosetta 2** | **60/60** — SSSE3 histogram bit-exact vs scalar |
| Dart unit + FFI tests (`flutter test`, VM) | **75/75 pass** |
| Dart tests **in the browser** (`flutter test --platform chrome`) | **60/60 pass** (unit + web visual-aid kernels, compiled to JS) |
| `flutter analyze` (package + example) | **No issues** |
| GitHub Actions CI (`native.yml`) | **Green**: macos-14, ubuntu (gcc `-Werror` V4L2 + `-mssse3` core), windows (MSVC /W4 Media Foundation), **web** (browser tests + web-app build) |
| Metal GPU cross-check (`metal_test.c`, Apple M1 Pro) | Histogram + zebra **bit-exact** vs C kernels; peaking within 0.005% |
| Live camera preview (example app, real Mac camera) | **Streaming** |
| Video recording (`.mov`) | **ffprobe-verified**: h264, 640×480, ~30fps, 34s, 14.7MB |
| RAW capture (linear-DNG + EXIF from the real camera) | **ffmpeg-decodes** the 1920×1080 6.2MB DNG; pixel round-trip exact on synthetic data |
| Burst capture | **5 PNGs in ~1.2s** from one click |
| EV bracket (−2/0/+2) | **Measured** mean luminance 25.8 / 96.9 / 183.4 |
| Multi-camera | Two backends opened **different physical cameras** concurrently |
| Web sample app in Chrome (getUserMedia) | **Live streaming** — 1000+ frames, all visual aids, capture ([screenshots](#web)) |
| dartdoc / `dart pub publish --dry-run` | **0 warnings** each |

## Web

The package compiles for the browser: a conditional-import split keeps `dart:ffi`
and `dart:io` off the web tree, `WebCameraBackend` drives the camera via
`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`, and the visual-aid kernels
(histogram / focus peaking / zebra / false color / waveform) are reimplemented
in pure Dart — the same algorithms as the C core, cross-checked to produce
identical output.

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/web_main.dart
```

Verified in Chrome against a synthetic camera device
(`--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`, which renders a spinning ball + timestamp):

| | |
|---|---|
| **Live preview + histogram** — getUserMedia stream, live RGB/luma histogram overlay | ![live](doc/web/web_01_live.png) |
| **False color** — pure-Dart exposure-zone map | ![false color](doc/web/web_02_falsecolor.png) |
| **Focus peaking** — pure-Dart Sobel edge highlight | ![peaking](doc/web/web_03_peaking.png) |
| **Waveform** — pure-Dart luma waveform monitor | ![waveform](doc/web/web_04_waveform.png) |
| **Capture** — `capturePhoto()` still held in memory (thumbnail, lower-right) | ![capture](doc/web/web_06_capture.png) |

The status card reports **Platform: Web, MediaDevices** and **Kernels: dart**, and
manual controls are honestly surfaced as *NotSupported* ("Not exposed by
MediaStreamTrack on this camera") — the capability passport working exactly as on
native.

## Measured performance

`src/tests/bench.c`, 1920×1080 RGBA, median of 31 runs, Apple M1 Pro, `-O2`:

| Kernel | ms/frame | fps |
|---|---:|---:|
| YUV420P → RGBA (NEON) | 0.66 | 1510 |
| Zebra | 2.0 | 502 |
| Digital zoom 2× | 2.1 | 472 |
| Histogram (scalar, auto-vectorized) | 2.3 | 437 |
| Waveform (256 cols) | 2.6 | 380 |
| Histogram (hand-written NEON) | 3.1 | 328 |
| Digital adjust (gain+EV+WB) | 6.9 | 145 |
| False color | 15.5 | 64 |
| Box blur r=6 | 20.9 | 48 |
| Focus peaking (Sobel, CPU) | 34.4 | 29 |

Honest notes: clang's auto-vectorized scalar histogram *beats* the hand-written
NEON version on M1 Pro (the scatter loop dominates) — both stay, both are
bit-exact. CPU focus peaking is the one kernel below 60fps at 1080p; that is
exactly why the GPU (Metal) path exists — the example uses it automatically.
| macOS manual controls (all six) applied to the live feed | **Verified** — ISO/exposure/WB visibly transform the feed; example reaches `Tier: Full manual (DSLR)` |
| macOS sensor-control availability (3-layer recon) | **Measured: none** — probed AVFoundation (0 controls), CoreMediaIO (`kCMIOExposureControlClassID` etc. exist but 0 control objects on-device), and IOKit/USB (0 UVC devices). Hence the digital pipeline. |
